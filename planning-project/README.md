# PlanningProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also
use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a
package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out
the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Env config

Add the `FIREBASE_API_KEY` key to the environment config files with the Firebase API token.

## Alternative Ngrx Syntax

> The NgRx team also released an alternative syntax for creating actions, reducers, effects etc.
>
> The approach and setup shown in this course is a bit more verbose (which actually has the advantage of seeing more of
> the things that go on under the hood). Exploring the alternative, a bit shorter syntax might therefore be an interesting
> next step.
>
> Jost created a nice post where he summarizes the new syntax + how to adjust the course project to use
> it: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/lecture/14466642#questions/7350498
>
> You also find the transformed code attached to this lecture!
>
> Also check out the official docs to learn more about it: https://ngrx.io/docs
>
> Again, just because it's important: This syntax is not better, faster or more secure than the one taught in the
> course. The entire switch of the official docs is pretty drastic (and hard to understand to be very honest) since the
> syntax taught in this course was the syntax used for close to two years now. Many teams will certainly still be on that
> syntax and that alone is a strong reason to learn it.
